#Rust OS Project

This is an unfinished operating system written in Rust, following the steps outlined in the Phil Opp blog (https://os.phil-opp.com/).


##Project Overview
The project aims to create a small and simple operating system using Rust programming language. This project is based on the tutorial series by Phil Opp, which provides a step-by-step guide to building an operating system from scratch using Rust.

##Project Structure
The project is divided into several modules, each of which covers a specific area of OS development. These modules include:
Bootloader
Kernel
Memory Management
Interrupt Handling
Drivers
User-space programs

##Project Status
The project is currently in an unfinished state. While it covers several modules, many parts are still missing or incomplete. The purpose of the project is to learn about the inner workings of an operating system and gain practical experience in Rust programming.

##Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need a few prerequisites:
A Rust installation
An x86_64 target for Rust
A toolchain for building the OS
Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can clone the repository and start working on the project.
